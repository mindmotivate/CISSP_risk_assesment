## Residual Risk = Total Risk – Countermeasures.

| Risk Score | Risk Rating        | Description                                                          |
|------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-3        | Low                | Low risk. The event is unlikely to occur, or if it does, the impact is minimal. |
| 4-6        | Moderate           | Moderate risk. The event has a reasonable chance of occurring with a moderate impact. |
| 7-8        | High               | High risk. The event is likely to occur, and it may have a significant impact. |
| 9-10       | Very High/Critical | Very high or critical risk. The event is highly likely to occur, and the impact could be catastrophic. |

According to Thor: Residual Risk = Total Risk – Countermeasures
Not all risks can be completely eliminated or mitigated. Even with the best efforts and countermeasures, some level of risk may exist!
Dont forget risks are always changing. Residual risk acknowledges this, therfore continuous monitoring is reuired!

Let's try to apply this to the two scenarios that Theo proposed:

## Turkey Dinner

| Risk Category      | Risk ID | Risk Description                                                 | Impact | Probability | Risk Score | Common Mitigation Steps                                       | Residual Risk                                           |
|--------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Health and Safety  | 1       | Choking on a turkey bone during Thanksgiving dinner in the office | High   | Possible    | 8          | - Provide training on how to properly carve and eat turkey. Ensure you have individuals trained in first aid present   | Continuous awareness and first aid readiness.             |

#### Residual Risks:

| Residual Risk                               | Description                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inadequate Training Implementation          | Even with training, there might be instances where individuals do not follow the guidelines properly, leading to a choking risk.            |
| Unforeseen Circumstances                    | Unexpected situations, such as a sudden health condition or distraction during the meal, may increase the risk despite training.             |

## Scoped in Colombia

| Risk Category      | Risk ID | Risk Description                                  | Impact       | Probability | Risk Score | Common Mitigation Steps                                       | Residual Risk                                           |
|--------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Personal Safety    | 2       | Possibility of being drugged in Colombia           | Catastrophic | Possible    | 8          | - Avoid drinking beverages from unknown sources. Avoid using tinder in columbia               | Staying alert remains crucial despite precautions.      |

#### Residual Risks:

| Residual Risk                               | Description                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unpredictable Issues?                    | Bad actors may employ sophisticated tactics that counter standard precautions, leading to an increased risk of being drugged.               |
| New Threat?                         | Evolving methods of drugging individuals, such as new substances or delivery mechanisms, could pose a risk that countermeasures might not immediately address.    |
| Social Engineering ?                | Bad actors might use social engineering techniques to gain trust, making it challenging to completely eliminate the risk of being drugged.     |
| Insider Man?                             | Individuals within trusted establishments may pose a risk, making it difficult to completely eliminate the threat of being drugged.            |
